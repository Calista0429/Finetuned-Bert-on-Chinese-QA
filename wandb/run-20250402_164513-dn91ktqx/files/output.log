Saving Model ...
Some weights of the model checkpoint at fnlp/bart-large-chinese were not used when initializing BartForQuestionAnswering: ['lm_head.weight', 'final_logits_bias']
- This IS expected if you are initializing BartForQuestionAnswering from the checkpoint of a model trained on another task or with another architecture (e.g. initializing a BertForSequenceClassification model from a BertForPreTraining model).
- This IS NOT expected if you are initializing BartForQuestionAnswering from the checkpoint of a model that you expect to be exactly identical (initializing a BertForSequenceClassification model from a BertForSequenceClassification model).
Some weights of BartForQuestionAnswering were not initialized from the model checkpoint at fnlp/bart-large-chinese and are newly initialized: ['qa_outputs.bias', 'qa_outputs.weight']
You should probably TRAIN this model on a down-stream task to be able to use it for predictions and inference.
